the documents for this repository are based of a word search game we designed in an introductory level Java class.

as of today, there are indentation issues that need to be addressed. other potential errors may be included but since i am new to git,
i figured downloading a "work in progess" would help me to better understand the tools and methods for designing here.

for instance... i just realized that these "README.md files do not have a spellcheck funtion. so, unofortunatLee :)  , i have not become 
the world's best speller overnight but instead am just not seeing the usual red underlining of Word documents
